# Kenmore Import
Data file contains address from King Co. and building outlines from Microsoft 
buildings trimmed to city boundaries. Conflation of addresses to buildings and 
to existing data will happen during the import in JOSM. Creation of multipolygons 
for complex buildings has not been done yet.
